# The Task

Using the wireframes we've provided try to to create the menu for both mobile
and desktop. We don't expect you to be able to create everything to pixel
perfection in the allocated time

Must haves:

* Read the menu from `src/menu.json`
  * You might need to update it, or suggest another structure if unsuitable for
    your implementation
* Working menu/desktop menus (even if not feature complete)
* Use of appropriate MUI components (e.g. Button)
* Update the README.md with:
  * What you'd do if you had more time
  * What design or UX improvements you'd make?

Not required:

* Searchbar
